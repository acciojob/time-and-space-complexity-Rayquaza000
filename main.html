	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes, using a certain input, to execute. It is the job of the programmer to make the code more efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>is the amount of memory required by a program. If there is only an array of n elements in the program then its space complexity is O(n)</p>
